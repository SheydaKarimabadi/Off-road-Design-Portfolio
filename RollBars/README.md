ðŸ›¡ Roll Bar Design for Multiple Off-road Vehicles

This project involved designing a modular roll bar system for various pickup models based on a single reference image. The goal was to deliver an aesthetically aligned, structurally accurate design without relying on 3D scan dataâ€”achieved entirely through manual measurements and precise modeling.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Type: Real-world Product Design

Purpose: Functional and aesthetic canopy systems for various vehicles

Tools Used: CATIA V5 (3D modeling), AutoCAD 2D (for laser cutting)

Reference Data: Market samples + vehicle body dimensions

Status: Approved, repeatedly manufactured, and still in production



âœ¨ Highlights

Delivered an accurate fit for multiple vehicle models without any 3D scan data

Designed a two-part modular system:

Rear section standardized for all vehicles

Front section customized for each vehicleâ€™s width, height, and brake-light position

Ensured perfect alignment with vehicle curves and slopes for aesthetics and functionality

Reduced unnecessary bends and minimized weld points for faster, more accurate assembly

First prototype was a perfect fit with zero rework

Repeatedly manufactured and still in production for multiple models


ðŸ§  What I Learned

Achieving precision design with manual measurements and no scan data

Managing aesthetic harmony with vehicle body lines

Designing modular systems that balance customization and manufacturing efficiency

Reducing complexity in fabrication to save time and improve quality
