âš¡ Rear Body Design for Electric Buggy

This project involved contributing to the design of the rear body section of an electric buggy. My focus was on the structural and aesthetic design of the rear shell to ensure it aligned with the overall vehicle concept, while meeting the requirements for weight optimization and manufacturability.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Type: Automotive Body Design

Purpose: Rear section body design for an electric off-road buggy

Tools Used: CATIA V5 (3D modeling), AutoCAD 2D (for laser cutting)

Scope: Rear body only, excluding chassis and front section

Status: Integrated into full vehicle design and approved


âœ¨ Highlights

Designed the entire rear shell with smooth, aerodynamic surfaces suitable for off-road use

Ensured structural strength while maintaining lightweight characteristics

Incorporated mounting points and clearances for lights and rear accessories

Worked in close coordination with the main body design team for aesthetic continuity

Successfully integrated into the final concept without major revisions


ðŸ§  What I Learned

Surface modeling techniques for complex automotive geometries

Balancing design aesthetics, weight, and structural performance

Collaborative design process within a multi-designer team environment

Applying manufacturability constraints early in the design phase
