Rear Off-road Cabin Design

This project presents a rear off-road camper cabin, developed and refined through multiple iterations using CATIA. Although the final design was not manufactured, it served as a powerful learning experience in surface modeling, modular structure design, and cost-to-manufacture evaluation.

📌 Overview

Type: Conceptual Design (Unbuilt)

Purpose: Rear cabin module for off-road/expedition vehicle

Tool Used: CATIA V5 – Generative Shape Design - Generaative Sheet Metal Design - Part Design

Design Iterations: 2

Status: Concept only (not manufactured)


✨ Highlights

Modular structure for potential mass customization

Focus on form-function balance and ease of assembly

Design optimized for off-road usage and rugged conditions

Surfaces and panels modeled for potential composite manufacturing


🧠 What I Learned

Translating abstract ideas into CAD with higher precision

Structuring a design based on both aesthetics and real-world constraints

The value of iterative redesign based on client and market feedback


> Even though the project was never manufactured, it's one of my favorites. It helped me realize how much I enjoy design—and how design suits me.
