ðŸš™ Canopy Design for Multiple Off-road Vehicles

This project involved designing custom canopies for multiple pickup models. Before I joined the company, they didnâ€™t produce canopies due to sealing issues on the doorsâ€”but I solved that challenge and created a production-ready design that became a repeatable product.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Type: Real-world Product Design

Purpose: Functional and aesthetic canopy systems for various vehicles

Tools Used: CATIA V5 (3D modeling), AutoCAD 2D (for laser cutting)

Reference Data: Market samples + vehicle body dimensions

Status: Approved, repeatedly manufactured, and still in production


âœ¨ Highlights

Designed canopies for several models (Toyota, G9, KMC 8, KMC 9, Kalut, Foton old, Foton new face, Foton  G7, Amico Asena and more)

Offered versions aligned with the vehicle roof and roof rack per customer request

Solved major water sealing issue for canopy doors (company couldnâ€™t produce before this)

Optimized hinge, latch, and door-to-body gaps for perfect fit and easy assembly

Achieved full sealing while maintaining smooth door operation (not too tight, not too loose)

Reduced design and production time from 10 days to 2.5 days (75% improvement)
 
     - Precise, standardized design, eliminated rework and grinding
     - Prepared CNC-ready files for error-free cutting and bending 
     - Optimized assembly 

Designs repeatedly manufactured and sold successfully


ðŸ§  What I Learned

Addressing real-world functional challenges like water sealing

Creating efficient assembly strategies and minimizing operator intervention

Balancing market inspiration with unique solutions

Optimizing design for speed without compromising quality

Working with tight tolerances and consistent performance across multiple vehicle models
