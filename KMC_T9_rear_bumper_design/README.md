ðŸš™ KMC T9 Rear Bumper Design

This project features a custom rear bumper designed for the KMC T9 pickup truck. Using the original point cloud data of the vehicle and referencing an aftermarket bumper design, I created a new version tailored to functional and aesthetic goals. The final model was approved by the project lead and went into manufacturing.
