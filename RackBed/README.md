ðŸ”© Rackbed Design for Off-road Vehicles

This project focused on designing a custom rackbed system that works in harmony with the previously designed roll bar. The first section of the rackbed is identical to the roll barâ€™s base, while the second section was newly designed to perfectly align with itâ€”ensuring both aesthetic integration and structural strength.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Type: Real-world Product Design

Purpose: Modular rackbed system for off-road vehicles

Tools Used: CATIA V5 (3D modeling), AutoCAD 2D (for laser cutting)

Reference Data: Existing roll bar base + manual vehicle measurements

Status: Approved, manufactured, and successfully installed on multiple vehicles


âœ¨ Highlights

Designed a two-part system that integrates with the roll bar without compromising strength

Maintained aesthetic consistency with the roll bar while adding additional utility

Achieved perfect structural alignment for durability and load-bearing performance

Optimized part design to simplify bending and welding operations, minimizing assembly time

Delivered a design that required no rework on the first prototype

Repeatedly manufactured and used across multiple vehicle models


ðŸ§  What I Learned

Creating complementary modular systems that visually and structurally integrate

Balancing strength, weight optimization, and ease of assembly

Applying previous design solutions (roll bar base) to accelerate development

Improving the overall design-to-manufacturing pipeline for accessory systems
